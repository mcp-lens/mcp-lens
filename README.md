- **Easy Configuration**: Quick access to edit your `mcp.json` files with proper validation
- **Developer-Friendly**: Built by developers, for developers who work with Copilot and MCP daily

## Features

- 🌍 **Automatic Discovery**: Detects MCP configurations from global VS Code settings and workspace `mcp.json` files
- 🔍 **Beautiful Interface**: Clean, card-based UI with real-time status indicators and tool information
- ⚡ **Server Control**: Start, stop, and restart MCP servers with one click
- 📊 **Live Updates**: See tool counts and status changes as servers load
- 🎯 **Smart Filtering**: Toggle between global MCPs, workspace MCPs, or view both
- 🔧 **Quick Configuration**: Direct links to edit your MCP configuration files
- 🎨 **Theme-Aware**: Adapts seamlessly to your VS Code theme
